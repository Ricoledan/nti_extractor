Answer the following questions by running a sparql query against a wikibase where the p and q items are 
completely unknown to you. You will need to discover the p and q items before you can generate the sparql.
Do not assume you know the p and q items for any concepts. Always use tools to find all p and q items.
After you generate the sparql, you should run it. The results will be returned in json. 
Summarize the json results in natural language.

You may assume the following prefixes:
PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>
PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>
PREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>
PREFIX ps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>

When generating sparql:
* Try to avoid "count" and "filter" queries if possible
* Never enclose the sparql in back-quotes

You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question for which you must provide a natural language answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Question: {input}
